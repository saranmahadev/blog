# Deploying my resume on EC2 ðŸš€

## Introduction

I have decided to take the Cloud Resume Challenge by Forrest Brazeal which is a complicated process. I have already did that on Azure but due to the limitations of Student Subscription, I was unable to complete the challenge and I modified the challenge due to the lack of knowledge and due to complicated aspects. This time, I am going to do it in the Amazon Web Services(AWS) without modifying and skipping any step on the flow.

## Deploying the site on EC2

As the first step, I am going to create the resume and deploy it on the EC2. We are going on a long road where as the first step I have to take *AWS Cloud Practitioner* before proceeding to the entire challenge and I am working on it. To get the hands dirty, I have just hustled around the Apache Server and built the resume site.

## Steps to deploy

### Step 1 - Create an Instance

1. Log into the AWS Account.
